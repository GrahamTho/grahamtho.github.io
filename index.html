    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Graham Thomas.
      I am 14 years old and a confused high school freshman and I love my hobbies.
      I grew up in San Marcos, Texas, But moved to North Carolina when I was ten because my mom went to graduate school at UNC.
      When this happened, I was upset to leave all of my friends, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.
      At least, for a while it wasn't.
      During fifth grade, I descended into the darkest depression of my entire life.
      It got so bad that I was hospitalized more times than I can count.
      When I finally recovered, I was fourteen years old.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      That's me right now.
      Happy, healthy, and sane.
      I am so thankful for my parents who have supported me through these hard times, and for my few friends who made life worth living.
      This is me.
