    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Graham Thomas.<br>
      I am 14 years old and a confused high school freshman.<br>
			I love my hobbies.<br>
      I grew up in San Marcos, Texas, But moved to North Carolina when I was ten because my mom went to graduate school at UNC.<br>
      I am 14 years old and a confused high school freshman and I love my hobbies.<br>
      When this happened, I was upset to leave all of my friends, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.<br>
      At least, for a while it wasn't.<br>
      During fifth grade, I descended into the darkest depression of my entire life.<br>
      It got so bad that I was hospitalized more times than I can count.<br>
      When I finally recovered, I was fourteen years old.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      That's me right now.<br>
      Happy, healthy, and sane.<br>
      I am so thankful for my parents who have supported me through these hard times, and for my few friends who made life worth living.<br>
      This is me.<br>
			I am strong.<br>
			I am smart.<br>
			I am brave.<br>
